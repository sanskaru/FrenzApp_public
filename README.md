# FrenzApp

So basically this is the first proper app I built.

## Getting Started

Download the ZIP file and open it on Android Studio.
```
I'm a noob, this is my first public repo
Sry
```

### Prerequisites

Android Studio should be installed on your system

```
What more do you want?
```

### Installing

Nothing much, just open it on Android Studio via the ZIP file you'll download from here.

```
Android Studio -> File -> Open-> Navigate to the downloads folder and open the ZIP
```

Or via Git.
For this you should have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your system.

```
Either via the VCS dropdown menu:
VCS -> Checkout from Version Control -> Git -> copy paste URL
or via git bash
```

## Running on Android phones directly

Method 1:
```
Note: You should have enabled "Installation from other sources" in your device settings.
```
APK will be added soon, stay tuned.
or, you can follow method 2 to directly install it via Android studio.
```
Note: You should have USB Debugging enabled from Developer Options on your device.
```
Open the ZIP on Android Studio, then connect your device and select Run 'app'.
Or just select Run 'app' and it would run on the AVD emulator, the default Android emulator on Android Studio.
